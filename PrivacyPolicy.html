                                            Visual Tools. Renohash may provide a wide variety of “Visual Tools” or
                                            software features that help you graphically or digitally represent ideas,
                                            conceptual relationships, or drawings. Some of these Visual Tools include:
                                            3D Ruler Tool, Mood Boards, Room Planner, 3D Floor Planner, dimensional
                                            information, and Room Scanning or other LiDAR technologies. Keep in mind
                                            that the Visual Tools are intended only to assist you and are not a
                                            substitute for your professional judgment, independent design, analysis,
                                            simulation, estimation, testing or other activities, including those with
                                            respect to safety and utility. Houzz will not be responsible or liable in
                                            any manner whatsoever for use of the Visual Tools, including the accuracy of
                                            measurements or any personal injury or damage to property. To reduce the
                                            risk of injury, only use the tools as intended, in a safe and controlled
                                            manner. Always be aware of your surroundings before beginning use and while
                                            using the Visual Tools. Use caution to avoid injury. Serious injuries can
                                            occur from tripping or striking walls, furniture, other objects or people.
                                            Houzz recommends clearing an area for safe use before using the Visual
                                            Tools. Remember that the objects you see in the virtual environment do not
                                            exist in the real world, and you should not attempt to sit or stand on them
                                            or use them for support. Take special care to ensure that you are not near
                                            other people, objects, stairs or steps, ramps, sidewalk(s), balconies, open
                                            doorways, windows, furniture, open flames (like candles or fireplaces),
                                            ceiling fans or light fixtures, televisions or monitors, or other items that
                                            you may impact or strike when using—or immediately after using—the Visual
                                            Tools. Remember that while using the Visual Tools you may be unaware that
                                            people and pets may enter your immediate area. Never use the Visual Tools in
                                            situations that require attention, such
                                            as walking, bicycling, or driving.<br>

                                            Binding Arbitration. You and Renohash agree that any dispute, claim or
                                            controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, our Privacy

                                            will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the dispute
                                            resolution provisions detailed in this Act 42 of 1965 . This means that you
                                            and Renohash both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury
                                            Exceptions to Arbitration. Each party retains the right to seek injunctive
                                            or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
                                            the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a
                                            party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
                                            intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring a
                                            claim against Renohash in "small claims" court, instead of by arbitration,
                                            but only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court
                                            and is brought in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis,
                                            and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an

                                            information sufficient for Renohash to identify any transaction,
                                            product, or service at issue (e.g., order confirmation, Renohash Pro
                                            subscription, etc); and (4) a detailed description of your Dispute, the
                                            nature and basis of your claim(s), and the nature and basis of the

                                            signature. If Renohash has a Dispute with you, Renohash agrees to first
                                            send a detailed Notice to your email address listed in your profile or
                                            via any other contact information you have made available to us.
                                            Renohash’s Notice will likewise set forth: (1) information sufficient
                                            for you to identify any transaction at issue; and (2) a detailed
                                            description of our dispute, the nature, and basis of our claims and any
                                            relief we are seeking. Your Notice must be individualized, meaning it
                                            can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.<br> You and
                                            Renohash agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute in an effort
                                            to swiftly resolve it without the need for a formal proceeding. If
                                            requested by Renohash, you and Renohash agree to personally meet and
                                            confer, via video conference, in a good-faith effort to resolve any
                                            claim covered by this Agreement. For sake of clarification only, this
                                            conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must
                                            be held each time either party intends to commence individual
                                            arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate
                                            in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually
                                            agreed by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel
                                            may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate
                                            in the conference. This process should result in resolution of the
                                            Dispute, but, if for some reason it is not resolved within 60 days after
                                            receipt of a fully completed Notice and the parties have not agreed to
                                            extend this time period, you or Renohash may initiate an arbitration.
                                            You and Renohash agree that compliance with and completion of this
                                            mandatory informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing
                                            any demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing
                                            fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this process.
                                            Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration administrator shall
                                            not move forward with the administration of any Demand upon written
                                            notice from Renohash that the other demanding party has not complied
                                            with the informal process. A court shall have the authority to enjoin
                                            the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a
                                            fully completed Notice and participating in good faith in this informal
                                            dispute resolution process. If we are not able to resolve the Dispute
                                            informally, then the below provisions will govern any Dispute. If you

                                            Class Action Waiver. You and Renohash agree that any proceedings to
                                            resolve Disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a
                                            class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that, in
                                            connection with any Dispute, you and Renohash both agree to waive the
                                            right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class

                                            writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not consolidate more than one
                                            person's claims and may not preside over any form of class action

                                            from the Initial Test Cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the
